    <h1>OVERCOMING WRITER'S BLOCK</h1>
   <main class="writers-block-section">

        <div class="solutions-container">
            <!-- Solution 1-->
            <div class="solution-box solution-1"
              <h2> <strong> TO WRITE SOMETHING ELSE </strong> </h2>
                <p>This can be the following:</p>
                <p>a. An academic paper or some homework that needs to be done for school</p>
                <p>b. A piece of creative writing (like a poem or a short story)</p>
                <p>c. An article on one of your favorite things </p>
                <p>Through this, your attention will be diverted from the block you are facing and you might find it easier to get back to the book you are writing/wish to write. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Solution 2-->
            <div class="solution-box solution-2"
              <h2> <strong>WRITE <i>SOMETHING</i></strong></h2>
                <p> I know that it sounds cliché but here are some things you can write: </p>
                <p>a. 1-5 sentences </p>
                <p>b. 1 chapter (if your block isn’t that grave)</p>
                <p>Now, once you get started with writing something (it can be just in one day or over the course of a few days), remember to take breaks and rejuvenate yourself and mind in that time. </p>
                <p>Remember that this is one step away from where you were and you are one step closer to your goal (whatever that may be)! Be happy and proud of what you wrote because that is <i>your creativity</i> and <i>your own passion.</i> </p>
            </div>    

            <!-- Motivational Quote-->
            <div class="motivational-quote">
                <p>YOUR CHARACTERS ARE WAITING FOR YOU TO WRITE THEM!</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Solution 3-->
            <div class="solution-box solution-3"
              <h2> <strong>LIST OUT YOUR MOTIVATIONS AND/OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS </strong> </h2>
                <p>Take a plain sheet of paper/open a page of a journal, or open an online document.</p>
                <p>Now, write/type down what all you accomplished with respect to your writing. It can be the most simplest of stuff as well (such as “Started with the 1st Chapter of my Book and introduced my Main Character). </p>
                <p>Now, take a deep breath and remind yourself (try to write/type this) of why you’re writing what you’re writing. </p>
                <p>Is it because you need the comfort you provide for your characters? Is it because you find murder mysteries intriguing and want to make/solve one yourself?</p>
