            <div class="solution-box solution-1"
              <h2> <strong> ALL BEGINNERS START WITH LITTLE TO NO EXPERIENCE </strong></h2>
                <p>Know that everyone starts off at a point wherein they know little to no information/experience about what they’re trying to write. </p>
                <p>Through this, try to accept and constantly tell yourself that you cannot be absolutely perfect and as you write chapter by chapter, you will improve. </p>
                <p>And well, the more you practice, the more you get better! Plus, to you, it may seem like “bad” writing but could actually be writing that is good in other people’s eyes. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Solution 2-->
            <div class="solution-box solution-2"
              <h2> <strong> <i>JUST WRITE</i> and DON'T EDIT</strong> </h2>
                <p> Just write and resist the urge to correct those blue lines and sentence structure. In order to resist editing your work on the spot, here are a few things you can do:</p>
                <p> a. Underline the word/phrase/sentence that you feel needs editing/does not make sense </p>
                <p> b. You can comment on whatever you wish to edit and leave it to your editor self </p>
                <p> c. You can keep a separate document/sheet of paper wherein you write all the changes you wish to make (although this might take a little bit more effort and could potentially break your flow)</p>
            </div>    

            <!-- Motivational Quote-->
            <div class="motivational-quote">
                <p>EMBRACE <strong>THE BEAUTY</strong> OF YOUR JOURNEY. EVEN THE LOW PARTS.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Solution 3-->
            <div class="solution-box solution-3"
              <h2> <strong> THINK OF THE COST OF PERFECTIONISM </strong> </h2>
                <p>You have the ability to write the story that once started as an idea and has bloomed into something beautiful that needs to be expressed. <i>Trust me.</i> </p>
                <p>Now, when you know you have that ability which is so special and dear, think of the cost of losing that ability of yours when you get taken over by perfectionism. </p>
                <p>It’s a lot, right? So, instead of letting perfectionism win, try to take it slow, remind yourself of why you started, and just keep going. </p>
                <p>And know that you are better than when you started (if you already started) and if you’re just starting, you are already better than the version of you that came up with the idea. </p>
