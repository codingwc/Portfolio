          <h3>DON'T DOUBT YOURSELF</h3>
          <p>Whilst you write, there is sometimes a doubt that mainly comes from an “inner-critic voice” that makes you second-guess your work and what you’re writing.</p>
          <p>In order to combat this, you must acknowledge and accept that this doubt is there (you can do this by taking a few deep breaths and seeing this “doubt” as something that keeps bothering you).</p>
          <p>Then, remember that this is your story, your imagination and creativity that you are putting into words with so much of hard-work. </p>
          <p>Try to remind yourself to trust in what you’re doing. After all, you’re on this journey because you love it and you have a dream, isn’t it? </p>
          <p>So don’t try to fight the doubt too much, that might drain you. Accept it and let yourself believe and trust in what you are working towards, and let that current of passion carry you onwards. </p>

          <h3>PATIENCE IS WHAT BUILDS BONDS</h3>
          <p>I know how if you’re writing a friends-to-lovers romance book/novel, you might wanna skip the friends part and jump to the lovers part.</p>
          <p>The thing is, for that to happen, the friends need to happen first. They need to experience and live the experiences that’ll shape their relationship with one another in the future.</p>
          <p>Think of it this way, if you want to get to the top of a staircase, you need to climb the stairs, right? And well, to climb the stairs, you must climb the stairs! So, it’s like that for writing as well. </p>
          <p>So, as much as you want to write the characters’ futures and their future relationships, take the time to develop them right now. </p>

          <h3>THERE IS NO "PERFECT" FORMULA FOR WRITING</h3>
          <p>You have your own potential and you have so much that you are capable of.</p>
          <p>You will adapt to your own writing style and how you would want yourself to write, as you write! And keep in mind, this will keep evolving too. </p>
          <p>So, every version that you are at is great in its own ways and you will get better as you keep doing it. So just keep working and you’ll see the improvement.</p>

        <div class="tip-column">
          <h3>GAIN FEEDBACK FROM TRUSTED PEOPLE</h3>
          <p>You could write a draft of what you would like for others to view and show it to your most trusted people (such as your partner, best friend, adult figures, etc).</p>
          <p>Ask questions about what they think of the characters, how detailed the imagery is.</p>
          <p>Take the feedback and work on it with a mindset that this will help your writing get better.</p>
          <p>Remember, don't take anything personal (this is just your audience(s) view.</p>
