          <h3>BREAK DOWN THE PLANNING</h3>
          <p>Whilst you plan your book, break it down into smaller chunks. These chunks are:</p>
          <p>1. Main idea of the plot & theme</p>
          <p>2. Main characters and their characteristics (doesn't have to be too detailed)</p>
          <p>A small outline of how you would like to start writing the chapters (ex.Chapters 1-3 will be character introduction; Chapter 3-5 will be the beginning of the plot).</p>
          <p>Remember, after planning, just start. Avoid going too in-depth with it since your story will progress and change as you write.</p>

        <div class="tip-column">
          <h3>SET UP ROUTINES WITH <strong>SMART GOALS</strong></h3>
          <p>SMART stands for "Specific", "Measurable", "Achievable", "Relevant", and "Time-Bound"</p>
          <p>In order to set these goals up, try to get as specific as you can.</p>
          <p>This routine can be either based off of when you feel the most motivated to write.</p>
          <p>Then, follow the routine and keep track of how much you're finishing.</p>
          <p>This method will help you get started and the trick of tracking your progress will not only help you be organized.</p>

          <h3>START WRITING AND EDIT LATER</h3>
          <p>Go ahead and choose how many chapters you want to write in a given time frame (ex. 2 chapters in 2 days).</p>
          <p>Then, just write and don't edit your lines here and there.</p>
          <p>This helps to avoid tiredness from editing every line and gives you more freedom to write.</p>

        <div class="tip-column">
          <h3>GAIN FEEDBACK FROM TRUSTED PEOPLE</h3>
          <p>You could write a draft of what you would like for others to view and show it to your most trusted people (such as your partner, best friend, adult figures, etc).</p>
          <p>Ask questions about what they think of the characters, how detailed the imagery is.</p>
          <p>Take the feedback and work on it with a mindset that this will help your writing get better.</p>
          <p>Remember, don't take anything personal (this is just your audience(s) view.</p>
